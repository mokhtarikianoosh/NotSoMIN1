To compile: Make sure to create the database Project3_Before and Project3 before importing their
sql files otherwise the import will not work. In MySQL Workbench, import the 
NotSoMinority_Project3_Before_MySQL.sql into a database called Project3_Before for running the before 
tuning queries in NotSoMinority_BefTuning_MySQL.sql. 
Note: The create database Project3_Before should create an error since if you've imported the sql file 
correctly, the Project3_Before database will already exist.
In MySQL Workbench, import the NotSoMinority_Project3_After_MySQL.sql into a database 
called Project3 for running the before tuning queries in NotSoMinority_AftTuning_MySQL.sql. 
Note: The create database Project3 should create an error since if you've imported the sql file 
correctly, the Project3 database will already exist.


To Run: After proper setup, click the lightening symbol in MySQL Workbench for each of the before
tuning queries. Repeat this process for the after tuning queries.


Database access information: database name is Project3_Before or Project3 depending which queries are being used, 
user is root and password is the TA's database password since he'll be running it on his system with the correct database. Program will ask for password as user input when run. Requires MySQL Workbench on the localhost computer.
